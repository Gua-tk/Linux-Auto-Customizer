  if [ -n "$attach_session" ]; then
    # * Putting this into .bashrc can give some problems, since all the functions that are after this file will not be
    #   loaded, since the terminal is blocked executing the tmux line. This means that when bash is loaded when
    #   launching a terminal, if the tmux is not loaded, the .bashrc will be loaded into this "first" bash environment
    #   until this line is found. Then, the .bashrc loading is interrupted by the execution of the tmux command.
    #   - At that point, tmux will launch the default shell which presumably will be bash (another new bash session
    #     hosted in tmux) and will load the same .bashrc, but this time tmux is already loaded so it will not encounter
    #     this "tmux" call because it is protected by the above if. If the tmux call is not protected, we would nest a
    #     session and presumably enter in an infinite recursive loop of tmux sessions; instead we will load all .bashrc
    #     functions into the bash environment that is being hosted by tmux as usual, giving to us a bash session with
    #     all .bashrc loaded into the bash session hosted by tmux.
    # * When we exit tmux, the blocking command "tmux" explained in the first bullet is finished, so the original bash
    #   session that we had in the beginning that was interrupted while was loading its .bashrc will continue
    #   parsing .bashrc contents.
    #   This gives us a problem if we intend to work with bash and with tmux in independent sessions. When exiting tmux
    #   and having the mouse on there is a buffer that is left behind in an inconsistent state, which results in the
    #   mouse movement producing trashy characters on screen. We can disable this buffer by "reset" command or
    #   manually changing the state of these buffers with "echo -en '\e[?1003l'" (or similar).
    #   In this case we are choosing "echo -en '\e[?1003l'" because if we use reset we would lose all the imports that
    #   we loaded into the original bash session until we executed tmux, leaving us into an inconsistent bash session
    #   state created by ourselves regarding all the imports of customizer already installed and its order regarding
    #   tmux imports (after or before).
    #   This solution is not perfect: The bash session where we return when we kill tmux had loaded all the data and
    #   functions in .bashrc before the tmux call the amount of time that we used tmux. After exiting tmux it loads the
    #   rest of the lines after the tmux call. This can cause trouble in functions or variables that are dependent on
    #   time events. Also it means that when we invoke a bash session we will be loading .bashrc one time for tmux and
    #   one incomplete time for the first bash session, which that incompleteness comes from all the .bashrc code after
    #   the tmux call. This means that this call should be the last to load in .bashrc, but because our bashrc features
    #   are independent, we can not make sure that this line will be the last to load (by now).

    # When there is a session created we can not change the directory since tmux is not a shell. Only the shell running
    # in that pane is the one capable of changing the current directory. To do so we need to "talk" to tmux in order to
    # inject the cd command into the shell in order to change the PWD of the active pane of the session. So, cding when
    # the session is already loaded is a thing that only the inner shell can do so we need to communicate with it from
    # outside using tmux command and sending the literal commands that we want to execute.

    # https://github.com/tmux/tmux/issues/2332
    # Of course we can find many edge cases in which we cannot change the directory because the terminal is busy:
    # - Because we are in the middle of a blocking call and then bash is not interpreting. --> Solution. We can check if
    #   bash is running. If bash is running we are not "probably" in a blocking call, so we can issue the command.
    #   Notice that this is not truly robust since sometimes you execute a bash program and the terminal is blocked, so
    #   it could be wrong sometimes.
    # - Because the buffer of the command input is filled with a half issued command --> Solution is adding the shortcut
    #   key M-#, which corresponds to Alt + #. This is a bash shortcut to put a # before the current line (silencing it)
    #   and then issuing enter to issue just a commentary.

    if [ "$(tmux list-panes -t 0 -F '#{pane_active} #{pane_current_command}' | grep -Eo "^1 .*$" | cut -d " " -f2-)" == "bash" ]; then
