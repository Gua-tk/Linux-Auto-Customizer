######################################## INSTALLATION SPECIFIC VARIABLES ###############################################
########################################################################################################################
# The variables in here follow a naming scheme that is required for each feature to obtain its data by variable        #
# indirect expansion. The variables that are defined for an installation determine its behaviour.                      #
# Each installations has its own FEATUREKEYNAME, which is an string that matches a unique feature. We use the name of  #
# the main terminal command installed by the feature used to run it. This string must be added to the array            #
# feature_keynames in common_data.sh to be recognised by the customizer as an available installation.                  #
# The variables must follow the next pattern: FEATUREKEYNAME_PROPERTY. Some variables can be defined in all features,  #
# some are only used depending on the installation type and others have to be defined always for each feature.         #
#                                                                                                                      #
#                                                                                                                      #
###### Available properties:                                                                                           #
#                                                                                                                      #
### Mandatory properties:                                                                                              #
#  - FEATUREKEYNAME_arguments: Array containing the arguments recognized to select the current feature. The arguments  #
#    are the "name" of the feature, which for third-party software is the known name of the software itself and for    #
#    functionalities is usually a description of what the function does in one or two words. Also, for historical and  #
#    practical reasons we keep the first argument as the main command that the feature installs, which coincides with  #
#    the FEATUREKEYNAME of the feature itself.                                                                         #
#    The arguments have to be in lower case and in the case of a possible separation by any symbol, use underscore (_).#
#    This will cause multiple argument matching in install.sh and uninstall.sh by ignoring case and interpreting       #
#    underscores as a possible separation with multiple underscores or multiple hyphens.                               #
#    For example, the feature with FEATUREKEYNAME "code" is the software Visual Studio Code which has the arguments    #
#    "code", "visual_studio_code" and "visual_studio". This matches the string itself plus their variants with         #
#    different casing or different separation, such as matching "Visual_Studio", "VISUAL-studio", "Code", "--code",    #
#    "--viSual_Studio", etc.                                                                                           #
#    The list of FEATUREKEYNAMEs is also used as first source of arguments, since it should contain the names of the   #
#    commands that are going to be installed, which is something that we can suppose unique.                           #
#  - FEATUREKEYNAME_name: Stores the feature's name. Maps to property 'Name=' of the desktop launcher if not
#    overridden.                                                                  #
#  - FEATUREKEYNAME_version: Feature version. For downloaded programs is the version of the downloaded bundle or binary
#    and for package manager installations or external feature is "System dependent" or "enterprise dependent"; for
#    example Google documents is "Google dependent". Maps to property 'Version=' of the desktop launcher if not
#    overridden.                                                                           #
#  - FEATUREKEYNAME_description: Feature objective description. Defines what is that you are installing. Maps to
#    property 'GenericName=' of the desktop launcher if not overridden.                                                           #
#  - FEATUREKEYNAME_commentary: Commentary for the feature. It can be anything relevant to comment about the feature or
#    its usage, but not its description (we have a metadata for that). Property 'Comment=' of the desktop launcher.
#  - FEATUREKEYNAME_tags: Contains keywords related with the feature. This keywords will be used to add the feature to
#    the wrapper with the same name as the tag that it is in. Maps to the property 'Keywords=' of the desktop launcher
#    if not overridden.
#  - FEATUREKEYNAME_icon: A name of the filename including its extension in
#    ${CUSTOMIZER_PROJECT_FOLDER}/data/static/${CURRENT_INSTALLATION_KEYNAME} that contains an image to represent the
#    feature. Maps to property 'Icon=' of the desktop launcher if not overridden. If an icon is not defined, the icon
#    will be deduced to
#    ${CUSTOMIZER_PROJECT_FOLDER}/data/static/${CURRENT_INSTALLATION_KEYNAME}/${CURRENT_INSTALLATION_KEYNAME}.${file_extension}
#    where ${file_extension} is svg or png. If this icon is not found, the icon will be the logo of the customizer, in
#    ${CUSTOMIZER_PROJECT_FOLDER}/.github/logo.png .
#  - FEATUREKEYNAME_systemcategories: Property 'Categories=' of the desktop launcher. It is used by Gnome to put the
#    launchers in the respective containers in the dashboard. This keywords will be used to add the feature to the
#    wrapper with the same name as the tag that it is in. Maps to the property 'SystemCategories=' of the desktop
#    launcher if not overridden.
#
#    * Main categories (all desktop launchers must have one of these categories)

#
#    Launcher categories in the dash (sorted when nemo is installed):
#    These are the classes in which the desktop launchers are classified. To know if a desktop launchers belongs to a
#    certain class the "Categories" field of a desktop launcher is used. This field contains a list of categories that
#    categorize the desktop launcher. These are used to group the desktop launchers in the dash.
#    The categories relate to the class in the following way:
#    Class name        |        Categories
#    accessories       |        Utility
#    chrome-apps       |        chrome-apps

#    features data. Property 'Icon=' of the desktop launcher. Fallback to customizer global icons.
### Optional properties                                                                                                #
#  - FEATUREKEYNAME_launchernames: TODO depreacate
#    Array of names of launchers to be copied from the launchers folder of the system.   #
#    Used as fallback for autostart and associatedfiletypes.                                                           #
#  - FEATUREKEYNAME_binariesinstalledpaths: Array of relative paths from the downloaded folder of the features to      #
#    binaries that will be added to the PATH. Its name in the PATH is added by using a ";" to separate it from the     #
#    relative path: "binaries/common/handbrake.sh;handbrake". It will be used to inherit when there is no override.    #
#  - FEATUREKEYNAME_bashfunctions: Array of contents of functions to be executed on the start of every terminal        #
#    session, in our case .bashrc.                                                                                     #
#  - FEATUREKEYNAME_associatedfiletypes: Array of mime types to be associated with the feature. Its launchers in       #
#    launchercontents or the defined launchernames will be used as desktop launchers to associate the mime type.       #
#    Optionally it can have a custom desktop launcher added after a ; of an associated file type to use a custom       #
#    .desktop launcher: "text/x-chdr;sublime"                                                                          #
#  - FEATUREKEYNAME_keybindings: Array of keybindings to be associated with the feature. Each keybinding has 3 fields  #

#  - FEATUREKEYNAME_downloads: Array of links to a valid download file separated by ";" from the desired name or full  #
#    pathfor that file.                                                                                                #

#  - FEATUREKEYNAME_downloadKeys: Array of keys that references a new download.
#    Each download can be configured with additional properties:
#    * FEATUREKEYNAME_DOWNLOADKEY_type: Optional property that can be "compressed", "package" or "regular". If not
#      defined, the behaviour will be one of the three below depending on the mimetype of the downloaded file.
#      "compressed": Means that after the download is completed in BIN_FOLDER it will try to decompress the file in
#      place if a single folder exists in the root of the compressed file, if not it will be decompressed in
#      BIN_FOLDER/CURRENT_INSTALLATION_KEYNAME .
#      "package": Means that after the download is completed in BIN_FOLDER/CURRENT_INSTALLATION_KEYNAME the downloaded
#      file will be installed as a package using the default package manager for the current operating system. If the
#      downloaded file is a compressed file, the file will be decompressed and all the packages inside will be installed recursively.
#      "regular": Means that the file has to be downloaded in BIN_FOLDER/CURRENT_INSTALLATION_KEYNAME and nothing more.
#    * FEATUREKEYNAME_DOWNLOADKEY_doNotInherit: If this variable is defined with some text in it and the type defined
#      or deduced for this download is "compressed", the file will be forced to be decompressed in place instead of
#      the decision between being decompressed in place if a single folder exists in the root of the compressed file or
#      being decompressed in BIN_FOLDER/CURRENT_INSTALLATION_KEYNAME in place.
#    * FEATUREKEYNAME_DOWNLOADKEY_downloadPath: if this variable exists the data in it will be used as the place where
#      the downloaded file will be placed.
#    * FEATUREKEYNAME_DOWNLOADKEY_URL: URL that will be used for the download.
#    * FEATUREKEYNAME_DOWNLOADKEY_installedPackages: This property is mandatory for completeness of the uninstallation
#      if the downloaded file is or contains packages to be installed. It enumerates the names of the installed
#      packages, so they can be used by uninstall to know which packages to uninstall using the default package manager.
#  - FEATUREKEYNAME_gpgSignatures: Array of urls pointing to gpgSignatures that have to be added to GPG_TRUSTED_FOLDER.
#  - FEATUREKEYNAME_sources: Array of strings defining sources that have to be added to APT_SOURCES_LIST_FOLDER
#  - FEATUREKEYNAME_manualcontentavailable: 3 bits separated by ; defining if there's manual code to be executed from  #
#    a function following the next naming rules: install_FEATUREKEYNAME_pre, install_FEATUREKEYNAME_mid,               #
#    install_FEATUREKEYNAME_post.                                                                                      #
#  - FEATUREKEYNAME_filekeys: Array containing the FILEKEYs to indirect expand file content and file path to create    #
#    a new file. Content and path of the file can be set using the two following variables:                            #
#    - FEATUREKEYNAME_FILEKEY_content: Variable with the content of a file identified in each feature with a particular#
