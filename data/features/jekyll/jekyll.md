Installs jekyll as a ruby gem that can be used for the offline display of sites from GitHub for Pages.

Based on this https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/ubuntu/

This installation must be installed as user.

You must install ruby first to provide the `gem` binary. You can provide this binary however you like, but we recommend
using the ruby installation from the customizer.
