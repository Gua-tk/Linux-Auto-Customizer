### Description
This feature adds new keyboard shortcuts to perform screenshots. It also adds new binaries in path to call the 
screenshot functionality. There are three types of screenshots: area, window, screen:
- *Area*: It allows you to select the area of the screen that you want to screenshot.
- *Window*: It screenshots the window on focus.
- *Screen*: Screenshots all the screen. 

To use them, issue the commands in the "path link" row in the next table or use the keyboard combination in the 
"keyboard shortcut" row.

| path link         | screenshot-area        | screenshot-window      | screenshot-screen      |   
| keyboard shortcut | Ctrl + Alt + Super + a | Ctrl + Alt + Super + w | Ctrl + Alt + Super + s |   

Note: Super is the "home" or "windows" key. 

Note for Mac users: We think that this is not going to work like we expect in a Mac because there is no Ctrl or Alt key,
only the command key. These shortcuts are untested in Mac because we do not have the hardware to test it.
